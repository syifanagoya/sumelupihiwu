Calero, the Global Creative Director for Moroccanoil, and Kevin Hughes, the Global Artistic Director for the brand, spoke to about how to achieve this.</p><p id=e5sTMHKvnv8d data-wc=67>Antonio explains that the "most important" part of recreating a style is instead of relying on what might be your favourite Eurovision look is to see "what products you have and what products they use to get that" adding that a lot of the behind-the-scenes is never seen on screen so that someone with a big "bouncy" hairstyle might actually have "fine hair, and we've used extensions".</p><p id=eiHzwBErfukp data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Who has won Eurovision Song Contest?

Calero is&nbsp;the Global Creative Director for Moroccanoil</strong></p><p id=exlw8NQrtGLr data-wc=38>Kevin agreed, and felt that one of the best things about this year's competition was how many of the acts were "embracing their natural curls", saying that many who have them "don't know how to care for them".</p><p id=e93uvuVq3lH2 data-wc=61>He shared that one of the ways to care for them is with a curl defining cream as it "covers from waves to much curlier&nbsp;hair. <strong>Not a lot of people know but you need a control factor to keep the definition of the curl because once it loses that, we see frizz </strong>and it's not because the hair is unhealthy."</p><p id=e5Fg-X2DMcdN data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Eurovision's most memorable contestants</a></strong></p><p id=eYTfPyhnEAK_ data-wc=53>Kevin went on to explain that the second someone's hair looks "healthier and shinier" people become more confident and comfortable with how they're looking. He added that the cream was perfect for this as it opens up a range of styling options "instead of just straightening them out, which is what most do".</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d2549c2d49a6-moroccanoil-curl-defining-cream-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eXZempDfgWga data-wc=5><strong>Moroccanoil Curl Defining Cream, £26.85, <a aria-label="curl cream" class="aff_text hm-link" href=# rel=nofollow>Feel Unique</a></strong></p><h6 style=text-align:center><a aria-label="curl cream" class="product__button hm-link" href=# rel=nofollow>SHOP NOW</a></h6><p id=eSFSJJPGA0G- data-wc=52>And when it comes to choosing the best products for the stars of Eurovision, Antonio shared that they watch the videos of the performances beforehand in order to identify what will work best for the performer, as they encounter all kinds of styles from "curls to hair with a more oily texture".</p><p id=e7qnYYxwnyQ0 data-wc=72>Kevin explained that the main acts, backing singers, and dancers&nbsp;who came to their&nbsp;chairs had different kinds of hair ranging from "chemically treated or highlighted lots", and that due to the blow drying process many of them had to use a restrictive hair mask either every four days or on a weekly basis, with the protein in the product keeping the hair in its "best possible shape as well as repairing".</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/beeb02d7566f-moroccanoil-restorative-hair-masque-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eI0hoiW8N9pN data-wc=5><strong>Moroccanoil Restorative Hair Mask, £34.75, <a aria-label="hair mask" class="aff_text hm-link" href=# rel=nofollow>LookFantastic</a></strong></p><h6 style=text-align:center><a aria-label="hair mask" class="product__button hm-link" href=# rel=nofollow>SHOP NOW</a></h6><p id=eCrOjgCDZLm7 data-wc=41>And when it came to non-chemically treated hair, hydrating shampoos and conditioners were the items of choice.
