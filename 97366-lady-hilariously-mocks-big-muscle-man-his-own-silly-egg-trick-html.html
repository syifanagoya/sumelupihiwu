Never miss important updates!</a></strong></p><p class=align-left>The internet has never been a place for the weak at heart and another hilarious clip that was shared online proves that this is true. In the clip that was shared by @BayouBun, a muscled man can be seen cracking an egg using his biceps.</p><p class=align-left>Not very long into the clip, a young lady can be seen attempting the same thing and actually succeeding but the only difference is that she does not have any muscles - which makes the man look quite silly for flexing his egg breaking ability.</p><p class=align-left>Thousands of social media users found the clip extremely hilarious and were soon heading to the comment section to make funny comments about it in the busy replies section. Read a few of them below:</p><p class=align-left>@nreleel said:</p>"She cracked it with her inner elbow. He used his bicep.

Taking to Twitter, a young South African media personality, @TumiSole, shared a hilarious clip of <a href=#>a soldier struggling to march correctly</a>.</p><p class=align-left>In the funny clip, the soldier seems to be unable to pull himself together which forces the captain to step up and try and assist him and even this doesn't help. In the caption of the post, Sole hilariously compares the two soldiers to president <a href=#>Cyril Ramaphosa</a> and Ace Magashule.</p>"Exclusive Vid of Cyril Ramaphosa trying to get Ace to tow the line! #ANCNEC," he wrote in the caption of the post.<p class=align-left><strong>Enjoyed reading our story?
