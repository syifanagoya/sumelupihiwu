Creator Taylor Sheridan, 53, later commented that he was “disappointed” by the decision.</p><p>“My opinion of Kevin as an actor hasn’t altered. His creation of John Dutton is symbolic and powerful,” he told The Hollywood Reporter. “It truncates the closure of his character. It doesn’t alter it, but it truncates it.”</p><p>It was recently reported, however, that Costner’s agents <a href=#>were “basically begging”</a> the co-creator to let Costner back in the show after “The Bodyguard” actor and his ex-wife Christine Baumgartner finally reached a divorce settlement, with Costner giving his ex more money than their prenup dictated.</p><p>According to Puck News, Costner’s reps allegedly managed to arrange a phone call between themselves and Sheridan, who had already written most of the final episodes. He was reportedly willing to rewrite in order to continue John Dutton’s storyline, but Costner’s alleged demands for more money, a reduced shooting schedule and script approval ended the negotiations.</p><p>New episodes of “The Kardashians” air Thursdays on Hulu and Disney+ at 12 a.m. ET.</p><p><a href=#>“Yellowstone” is now airing</a> from the beginning Sundays on CBS at 8:30 p.m. ET.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3Jma3BfoL%2Bqv4yjnKemlad6p7vRnJydZZKkxqe%2ByJ6lnWWkpHqzscmemq1lqZq5rbvWrKuoppViv7C4xGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
