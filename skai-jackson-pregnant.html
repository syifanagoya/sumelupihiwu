It is important to separate fact from speculation amid reports of weight gain and plastic surgery.</p><p>Skai Jackson tweeted in November 2019 that “they messed up on my weight…” after discovering that the information about her weight was incorrect. I’m not 86.” After sharing a bikini selfie to Instagram, Skai was accused of plastic surgery.</p><p>Although rumors of a major weight gain or plastic surgery on Skai Jackson’s part have circulated, hard evidence of either is still lacking.
