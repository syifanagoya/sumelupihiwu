In the shot, the star wore a black top with exaggerated puffy shoulders, and her tousled choppy 'do was pushed behind one of her ears and styled in gentle waves with a deep side part.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Her summer-ready glam was bronzy, naturally, and also included a thick eyeliner and pink lip. Funky silver earrings, as well as a diamond stud and tiny hoops, were on full display in the ear that held back one side of her new 'do.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Got my summer cut ‚Ä¶ all ready for the holiday weekend," she captioned the post before showing off her comedic edge with an irreverent joke.

At the time, her signature blonde hair was shoulder-length and pulled into a half-back style. When she wasn't slaying on the pink carpet, Gellar was actually being honored with the Canal+ Icon Award. While speaking with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Variety</a> during the festivities, the actress revealed why now was the right time for her to make her eagerly awaited return to the screen.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">‚ÄúI very much was ready to come back,‚Äù she told the outlet though admitted she had ‚Äúsome apprehension.‚Äù ‚ÄúLike, do people still want to see you? Does it still work?‚Äù Ultimately the script for her show Wolf Pack is what really sold her on coming back to the spotlight. ‚ÄúOne of the things I loved about Buffy was that the monsters were a metaphor for the horrors of adolescence,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúAnd Wolf Pack was taking that concept and doing it about [what they] face now: anxiety, depression, isolation. I really loved having a way to speak about that without being preachy, but sort of opening up that dialogue.‚Äù</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK570pqpmqBdoraktMSlo55ll5q5ra3RZqqhp6KpeqO7wWagp6uklrSzrcxmqp6klp6yboOUaWtwaWc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
