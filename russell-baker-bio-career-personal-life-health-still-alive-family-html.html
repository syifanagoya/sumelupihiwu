He grew up in a family with meager income, and on top of that, went through the pain of losing his father. His father, a stonemason, died of untreated diabetes when Russell was at the tender age of five.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>However, his mother, a strong-willed woman, and a trained schoolteacher encouraged his aptitude for learning language despite poverty. Without any definite prospects of attending college, Russell completed secondary school in Baltimore’s beautiful City College. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>When Russell turned 16, his mother remarried, which abled them to move into their own home. During an age, where a typical teenager would have fun on their mind, Russell realized his only ambition was to become a writer despite acknowledging the fact that it would not provide a sustainable livelihood.</p><p>However, with the ambition that did not promise him a golden fortune, Russell went for it with the persuasion of one of his classmates who advised to go forth and achieve his dream of being a writer.</p><h3><strong>Russel Baker's Bio: Career Breakthrough As Writer From New York Times</strong></h3><p>Russell, determined to become a writer was only able to complete just one year of college after getting enlisted in the navy in 1943.
