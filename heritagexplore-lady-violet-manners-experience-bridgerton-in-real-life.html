"HeritageXplore was mainly born out of the seed that was planted back in 2020 with ‘The Duchess Podcast' and travelling around the country with my mum," The tech entrepreneur explains over a coffee at Soho House.&nbsp;</p><p id=eBeJ1vWBvHK data-wc=6><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>The Radar: The OOO Edition</a></strong></p><p id=eHIKGjxJZU data-wc=13><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>I saw a 'Transformation Coach' for a month and it changed everything</a></p><p id=ea4adNRN9Ry data-wc=89>Upon returning from her studies in the US, Violet did what any ambitious millennial would do, she started a podcast while balancing her full time job. The strategic consultant, who ran her own business Akana, launched the podcast to allow listeners to learn about the history of historic houses through the women who help to run them. Her mother, The Duchess of Rutland, devoted her life to Belvoir Castle as its chatelaine and was main the source of inspiration for The Duchess Podcast series which ran for three years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/3b061b1e4e54-gettyimages-979609578.jpg><p id=eWM4tDjkS7r data-wc=47>"I really created that podcast with an ambition for it to be a successful side hustle, and draw the stories out of these buildings into a modern medium,” she explains saying that she wanted, “to discover new audiences for these houses and the history that they hold."&nbsp;</p><figure class="HFMQuote_hd2j4x3 quoteClass_qcs0mq1 -category-culture -style-2"><p id=e1nfhjjoSn>"The challenge is, how do you reach new people?"</p></figure><p id=eOtHEcKDgcQ data-wc=46>“Growing up in somewhere like Belvoir, I recognise it's so unbelievably unique and incredibly lucky. What I found fascinating about making the podcast is that every single historic house owner in the 21st century has to look at their homes through the prism of an entrepreneur.”</p><p id=etu-eQOXYC data-wc=64>This venture led to a lightbulb idea to expand the podcast into something more: organising once-in-a-lifetime opportunities to visit, meet, and stay at some of the homes featured on the podcast. Thus, HeritageXplore was born, “I genuinely had, like, a bit of a light bulb moment in December 2022 when I was like, ‘Why do none of these houses sit in one centralised place?’”&nbsp;</p><p id=ebDuF8NxWT data-wc=9><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>Must-see London fashion exhibitions to visit in 2024</a></strong></p><p id=e4BefwYLzGE data-wc=10><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>The chicest new restaurant openings in London in 2024</a></p><p id=ey5SHn98qw7 data-wc=67>With the cost of living crisis prompting more people to choose staycations within the UK, HeritageXplore is set to be the perfect solution for unique visits. Like SkyScanner or AirBnb, the platform allows you to seamlessly discover and book trips to independent historic houses all in one place, "We are a generation of marketplaces, and there wasn’t a marketplace for the independent sector of heritage," notes Violet.</p><p id=e1upUgz1xnt data-wc=40>Growing up she saw first hand by observing visitors' perspectives how exciting stepping into British history was for them, "You see these places through their eyes, and I quickly realised there's such an amazing opportunity to celebrate these places collectively."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/0f66a27fb34b-screenshot-2024-06-29-at-131737.jpg><p id=eSq5L96GUHs data-wc=49>Despite their glamorous history, these homes are rife with challenges which the platform aims to help offset.
