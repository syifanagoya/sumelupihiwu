His son, Skender Cobaj, 51, was cut on the hands and later released from the hospital.</p><p>MaryAnn Nelson, 72, said the deceased victim was “a great neighbor” who would “give you the shirt off his back.”</p><p>She said she saw Pompilii’s wife screaming at her husband’s alleged killer as police whisked him away.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Pompilii “was friendly to everyone,” including his alleged killer, neighbors said, <span class=credit>Frank Pompilii/Facebook</span></figure><p>“‘I hope you die! I hope you die!’” the devastated wife yelled, according to Nelson.</p><p>Nelson’s husband, Bill, called the stabbing spree “totally senseless” and said it was perpetrated for seemingly “no reason.”</p><p>One resident who knew both Pompilii and Ramusevic said the elderly victim “never harmed a fly.”</p><p>“He was always smiling, saying hello. Who would harm a man like that?”</p><p>Pompilii, Cobaj and Ramusevic frequently chatted, the resident said.</p><p>“They were always hanging out and talking. I don’t know what they were talking about, but they knew each other very well,” the neighbor noted. “They always have some conversation, the two old guys and the younger guy.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Frank and Doreen Pompilii were married for more than 50 years. <span class=credit>Frank Pompilii/Facebook</span></figure><p>The resident said he would say “Hi” to the accused killer, who once owned a nearby pizzeria, but “he never answered back.”</p><p>He added that he didn’t think the assailant “was friendly with anyone else” besides the man he allegedly killed.</p><p>Pompilii, meanwhile, “was friendly to everyone,” the neighbor said.&nbsp;</p><p>“He was the nicest man you could ever meet — very kind, very generous, always a smile on his face.”</p><p>Pompilii was a father of two and grandfather of six who had been married to his wife, Doreen, for more than 50 years, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">according to the Staten Island Advance</a>.&nbsp;</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Neighbors say that Ramusevic, who was “having problems,” seemed to have lashed out in an unprovoked fit of rage. <span class=credit>Michael Dalton</span></figure><p>A native of Abruzze, Italy, Pompilii arrived in America at age 17 and worked for decades making and cutting uniforms for companies on Staten Island and in the Bronx.</p><p>Another neighbor, Terence Bennett, 59, said he’d known Pompilii since he was a teen.</p><p>The older man and his wife “took us places, movies and stuff like that. … I’m upset,” Bennett said.&nbsp;</p><p>“Frank was a nice guy,” he added. “He was always helping people out. He took me to pick up my car last summer. I used to walk my dog and stopped and chit-chat with him.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3Jma25fp66urdmapWaqkaLCtLHVoppmm5iWv6ixw2auoqyYYrq2vsOeqaKml2Kzs63NnJysm59ivbC5z6KjoqFdmLyxv44%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
