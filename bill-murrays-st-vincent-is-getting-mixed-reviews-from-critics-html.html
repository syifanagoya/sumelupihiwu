Between <a href=#>the tale of Bill Murray’s casting</a> and its warm reception at the Toronto International Film Festival, Vincent has an interesting behind-the-scenes tale as director Ted Melfi’s debut feature, but <a href=#>Flavorwire’s review</a> sums up the biggest takeaway from most of critical response: “Who’re we kidding – no one’s seeing St. Vincent for its narrative innovations. This is a Bill Murray Picture, and it’s full of opportunities for him to do his thing.” The good (and unsurprising) news is that Bill Murray’s performance in St. Vincent has garnered tons of praise, while the bad news lies in the script, pacing, and Melfi’s tendencies toward drawing out overly sentimental “movie moments.” Here’s what some of the critics are saying:</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0qspne19gzwbmcdx4gfmvj@published data-word-count=30>“The direction is negligent and the jokes are mild. It’s an O.K. little picture that doesn’t really go anywhere, but it has a resonance that is easy on the heart.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0qspne19h0wbmcklsxvcww@published data-word-count=4><span style=font-size:13px>- </span><a style=font-size:13px href=#>New York Observer</a></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0qspne19h1wbmct5fs0iet@published data-word-count=42>“Vincent gets some laughs, because Murray is a wizard of delivery, even when he’s holding back his deadpan wisecracks and conversational riffing in favor of an old-school Brooklyn yawp. As written, though, the character could fit right in on a CBS sitcom.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0qspne19h2wbmcuzjufhf1@published data-word-count=4>- <a href=#>The A.V.

The most lovable curmudgeon in modern movies gets a valedictory lap (and, you suspect, another Oscar campaign) in Theodore Melfi’s crowd-pleasing yet dangerously sentimental wacky-neighbor dramedy.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0qspne19h6wbmcyej1x7zw@published data-word-count=3>- <a href=#>Time Out</a></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0qspne19h7wbmc9hgq7p7f@published data-word-count=43>“This may not be his signature work, but it’s Murray at the top of his game in the type of role audiences want to see him in. Frankly, it’s somewhat surprising it took him this long to find a project in this vein.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0qspne19h8wbmc170eqv1t@published data-word-count=2>- <a href=#>HitFix</a></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0qspne19h9wbmc5kdy4mi2@published data-word-count=57>“Writer-director Theodore Melfi (directing his first feature) has a good eye for composition — his specialty is a well-framed overhead shot, which he trots out a few times, but not too many — and he maintains a brisk pace, though the picture’s turn towards the melancholy is awfully abrupt, and too clumsily telegraphed by Theodore Shapiro’s score.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0qspne19hawbmc63rdhj1h@published data-word-count=2>- <a href=#>Flavorwire</a></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0qspne19hbwbmcerq8x2cg@published data-word-count=58>“Even though the film willfully ignores plenty of real-life issues as it rushes toward its denouement, beginning with some basic economic ones, Melfi has laid on the heart of gold stuff so sincerely that mainstream audiences might just eat it up. There’s good in every soul, the film endeavors to say; it’s just a question of finding it.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0qspne19hcwbmc5j4syvho@published data-word-count=4>- <a href=#>The Hollywood Reporter</a></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0qspne19hdwbmcx2h8br1n@published data-word-count=65>“Yet nothing can make a discerning viewer feel worse than seeing a ‘feel-good’ movie like this one. Melfi ends scenes with visual punch lines that play like rim shots; he forces salvation on everyone (including Oliver’s bully); he politicks shamelessly for emotional uplift. This barrage of kitsch is enough to turn any saint in the audience into the old, grouchy Vincent, before he got canonized.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0qspne19hewbmc2ila03lu@published data-word-count=2>- <a href=#>Time</a></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0qspne19hfwbmc8vzs3mhw@published data-word-count=48>“It’s fascinating to watch Murray act circles around his existing appeal and play into it at the same time. Melfi’s likable but utterly formulaic movie never rises to a similar level of ambition, which in this case actually works in its favor. It gives Murray room to play.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/splitsider-cjh0qspne19hgwbmcaaqocntc@published data-word-count=2>- <a href=#>Indiewire</a></p><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Bill Murray’s ‘St. Vincent’ Is Getting Mixed Reviews […]</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlobWdhZXyjtculZKatoqeuur%2BMrKtmrpmjsKa602agrGWXmsG1tc2gZKahqJqxbr7Er6Cer6Nis7O7zGaaq6GknrC0esetpKU%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
