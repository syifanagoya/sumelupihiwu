The powerhouse <a href=#>K-pop</a> girl group is set to release their much-anticipated album <a href=#>Kill My Doubt</a>&nbsp;in July 2023. Keep reading for details on their 2023 comeback, pre-release singles, album and more.</p><h2>When Is ITZY Releasing Their Album? 2023 Comeback Details</h2><p>ITZY is preparing to release their album Kill My Doubt&nbsp;on July 31, 2023, with the lead single and music video “Cake” dropping on the same day.</p><p>The girl group also dropped the pre-release video for “Bet on Me” on July 3, with the second pre-release track “None of My Business” premiering on July 24.</p><p>ITZY admitted that the group still gets nervous about their upcoming comebacks, but they are positive fans will like the new songs. “We’re still a little bit nervous because we had lots of songs before,” Yuna told <a href=#>UpRoxx</a> in June 2023. “When we release the new music, I think our fans will love these new songs on the album but that thinking makes me nervous.”</p><p>Members in K-pop groups often change up their appearance every comeback, and specifically, their hair. For ITZY’s upcoming comeback, it was <a href=#><strong>Lia</strong></a>‘s turn to take on the hair-changing task.</p><p>Being the only member who hasn’t bleached her hair since debut, the vocalist went blonde! “I was actually worried before dyeing it,” Lia told <a href=#>UpRoxx</a>. “It’s not like I wanted to do it, but it was a suggestion because I never tried dying my hair after debut. It was always dark so somehow I thought ‘Okay. I guess it’s my turn.'”</p><p></p><h2>Who Are ITZY?</h2><p>Known for their impressive choreography and catchy lyrics fueled with girl power, ITZY debuted as a girl group under JYP Entertainment on February 12, 2019. The members include leader&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Yeji</strong>,&nbsp;Lia,&nbsp;<strong>Ryujin</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Chaeryeong</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Yuna</strong></a>.</p><p>ITZY’s name is a play on the Korean word “to have it all,” and the group is one of the most groundbreaking K-pop acts in the fourth generation.</p><p>“Our members were meant to perform,” Lia told&nbsp;Teen Vogue in August 2022. “Individually, their dance skills are awesome. Even when they were trainees, their dancing skills were great.”</p><p>“All the members are really capable in many ways,” Ryujin added. “We can be a performance group, but we can try anything and have a great result.”</p><p><strong>Click through our gallery for all the details on ITZY’s upcoming 2023 comeback.</strong></p><p>Love J-14?
