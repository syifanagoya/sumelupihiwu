I don't know what's more amazing. The fact that Zedd was just 28 when he plunked down $16 million for this property… OR… the fact that just three little years later he thinks it can fetch $26.5 million. In other words, if he gets the asking price, Zedd will have essentially been paid $3.5 million per year to live in what is a truly spectacular mansion.</p><p>Built on spec in 2016, the developers crafted an 11,000 square-foot modern masterpiece to sit on the property's 3.2 acres.</p><p>After construction was completed, they tried to get $25 million but there were no takers for a full two years before Zedd swooped in with his $16 million offer.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-322207 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/zedd.jpg alt width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1372px) 100vw, 1372px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-322207 class=wp-caption-text>Via The MLS/Westside Estate Agency</p><p>The property was 99% complete before Zedd took ownership, but he did proceed to add a game room, production studio, soundproof movie theater and a custom skittles dispenser.</p><p>Zedd gave Architectural Digest a tour of the property about a month after moving in:</p><p></p><p>But I actually think this real estate promo video does a better job of showing off the home's incredible features:</p><p></p><p>The first 30 seconds of that second video really shows off the uniqueness of the property. Note that this is 3.2 acres on a hilltop in Beverly Hills. This is a serious piece of land with views that would never get old.</p><p>Not sure why Zedd has decided to sell. <a href=#>With a net worth of $50 million</a>, Zedd is one of the <a href=#>20 richest DJs on the planet</a>.</p><p>Maybe he's going to take his profits and buy something even bigger and more spectacular?!?!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcK%2FEpZybqpmpxm60zqacrGdjZnq6scCrZKiklGKxq3nZnpudZZyewLW%2FjKynnpuklrC2uMCrZJudppq%2FrcWMoaClpKNiuqK60qKmp2WWpL9ufpVmbGalmaG5qrvNaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
