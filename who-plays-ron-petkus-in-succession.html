We knew it was coming, but to have it happen so early on in the season was a bold move on the writer’s part.

He also makes a regular appearance alongside <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bill Hader</a> in another HBO series, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Barry,</a> as Monroe Fuches. Coincidentally, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Barry is also starting it’s fourth season.</a></p><p data-characters=294 data-current-count=294 data-injectable=false>Will Root be making any more appearances in Succession? It’s unlikely. The show has seven episodes left before it concludes for good, and the show’s writers will probably want to focus on the main drama of the story. That probably won’t bother Root much, as he seems busy enough as it is.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tM5mp6WZqah6s7vNZqeerJuqwG61zWaqrpuTmsC0tc6nZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
