Who is Jay Park dating now & how much money does Jay Park have?</p><h2>Jay Park Biography</h2><p align=justify><strong>Jay Park</strong> is one of the most popular and richest <strong>Rapper</strong> who was born on <strong>April 25, 1987</strong> in Edmonds, Washington State, <strong>United States</strong>. Korean-American hip hop singer and dancer who initially gained fame as a member of boy band 2PM. He later gained YouTube fame by releasing covers of other popular artists. He has won multiple awards, like Musician of the Year at the Korean Music Awards in 2013.</p><p>He gained a large internet following for his cover the <a href=#>Bobby Ray Simmons</a> song “Nothin’ On You.”</p><p>Park’s music takes its roots in R&B and hip hop, more specifically from the 90s. He is influenced by the work of American artists he grew up listening to, such as Usher, Michael Jackson, Ne-Yo, Chris Brown, Ginuwine, Musiq Soulchild, Justin Timberlake, Eminem, Jay-Z, Nas, Tupac, Dr. Dre, and Canibus. Park credits Usher as his idol and as one of his biggest influences, who he started listening to in the 6th grade. He also cites Michael Jackson as his role model, as “he is the best”. He cites both Usher and Michael Jackson as singers and dancers who influence him vocally and in dance, as he attempts to mimic them, looking at their music videos. Park also cites Chris Brown as an inspiration, and wants “to be a singer who can be good at both singing and rapping like [him]”. Park began listening to hip hop music when he was in second grade, after one of his cousins let him listen to Warren G’s “Regulate”. In general, Park stated he “doesn’t really listen to music to get inspiration, I listen to music because I listen to music, but I do get inspired when I listen to music, it definitely helps”.</p><p>Born in Edmonds, Washington, in the Seattle metropolitan area, Park showed great interest in hip hop music and breakdancing at a young age. Park attended Edmonds Woodway and Meadowdale High School, where he spent most of his break and lunch times practicing dance with friends. Park started listening to hip hop and rap music in his early teens, and spent time learning and writing raps himself during high school. In 2003, Park became one of the first members of the Seattle-based b-boy crew Art of Movement (AOM). In 2004, Park’s mother, seeing how her son spent more time breakdancing than studying, suggested he audition for Korea-based JYP Entertainment, which brought him to Korea in January 2005 to receive further training in dancing, rapping, singing, and the Korean language. Park eventually completed his university education at Dankook University.</p><p align=justify>He has a younger brother named Jehan.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Jay Park</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Jay</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Park</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Rapper</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>April 25</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1987</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Edmonds</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Washington State</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Taurus</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Jay Park ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

In September 2009, Park returned home to Seattle after comments he wrote about Korea in 2005 as a teenager were publicized by the Korean media; Park officially left the group in early 2010. In March 2010, Park uploaded a cover video of B.o.B’s hit “Nothin’ on You”, with his own rap and lyrics, to YouTube, which went viral and reached over 2,000,000 views in less than 24 hours, leading to the release of Park’s first EP, Count on Me in July 2010, which debuted at number one on the Gaon chart. Park returned to South Korea in June 2010 for the filming of Hype Nation, while being represented by Digital Media Wire’s CEO and entertainment attorney Ned Sherman, and in July 2010, Park signed a contract with SidusHQ, one of the largest agencies in South Korea, re-debuting as a solo singer and an actor.</p><h2>Jay Park Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Jay Park is one of the <strong>richest Rapper</strong> from United States.

Park started as a b-boy and dancer, known for his charismatic performances and stage presence. Park was described as a “born entertainer” by Korean pop singer Patti Kim, and The New York Times quoted the president of digital music distributor DFSB Kollective describing Park as “not just an artist, but also his own PR agent, fan club president, and TV network.”</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$10 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Rapper</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Soon after Park returned to the United States, the South Korean public changed their perspective on the matter when they realized that his Myspace messages had been severely mistranslated and taken out of context, in addition to strong fan support for Park’s return. Park was seen at b-boy battles with fellow Art of Movement members during his time in Seattle. However, on February 25, with Park’s comeback looking more and more likely, JYP suddenly announced that Jay Park’s contract with them had been terminated, citing a separate “personal mistake” that Park had made in 2009. JYP would make reference to this unknown event several times in 2010, but would never elaborate on any details. This termination had been agreed by all six members of 2PM and led to fan boycotts on 2PM-endorsed products. Protests for Park’s return to the group began to take place, not only in South Korea, but internationally as well. Various Jay Park-dedicated forums and fansites all over the world organized silent protests and flash dance mobs. Fans also hired a plane with a banner showing “J, what time is it now?” to fly over Seattle, and was broadcast on Seattle-based radio stations.</p><p>On September 4, 2009, unfavorable comments towards Korea were found on Park’s personal Myspace account from 2005. The comments, written in English to a friend, were translated by Korean media, quickly spreading across hundreds of news articles. Park expressed deep remorse and shame over his forgotten words and issued an official apology, explained the unhappiness that he experienced during his early days as a trainee in an unfamiliar country where he lacked family, the ability to easily communicate, and an understanding of the culture. Although outraged protesters demanded that Park should be removed from 2PM, JYP Entertainment’s CEO, Park Jin-young, stated on September 7, 2009, that he was going to continue as a part of the group. The following day, Park announced on his official fancafe that he would be leaving the group to calm the situation and return to his hometown, Seattle, Washington. He also apologized to the other 2PM members, and promised that he would “come back a better person”. Park Jin-young then confirmed that 2PM would continue as a six-member group. Additionally, due to the sensitive topic of Park’s departure, all 2PM members were withdrawn from their regular appearances on variety shows, and the final episode of their reality show, Wild Bunny, was postponed indefinitely. Park’s vocals would not be removed from the older songs he promoted with 2PM, but he would be absent from the newer tracks, and the remaining six members of 2PM re-filmed their music video for “Heartbeat” without Park on October 31, 2009.</p><h2>Height, Weight & Body Measurements</h2><p><b>Jay Park height</b> <strong>5 ft 7 in</strong> Jay <strong>weight</strong> Not Known & <strong>body measurements</strong> will update soon.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Height</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>5 ft 7 in</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Weight</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Body Measurements</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Eye Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Hair Color</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Feet/Shoe Size</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Park first appeared through Mnet’s Hot Blood Men, a documentary-style reality program that showed the future members of One Day, split as idol groups 2AM and 2PM, in training.
