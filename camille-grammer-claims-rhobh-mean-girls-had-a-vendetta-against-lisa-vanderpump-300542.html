On social media, fans are praising Grammer for avoiding the peer pressure. And, she responded by tweeting that Teddi Mellencamp, Lisa Rinna, Kyle Richards, and Dorit Kemsley had a vendetta against LVP and they were mad at her for not falling in line.</p><p>The RHOBH mean girls have been <a href=#>calling out Grammer in recent episodes</a> for being two-faced, claiming that she says nice things about Vanderpump while slamming Kemsley for her financial problems and accusing Mellencamp of stirring up drama.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=# rel=nofollow>@TheRealCamilleG</a> thank you for your honesty – you confirmed for the <a href=# rel=nofollow>#RHOBH</a> viewer's that we were witness to what happened to <a href=# rel=nofollow>@LisaVanderpump</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow>pic.twitter.com/yVF5v3izOf</a></p><p>— jw (@burgundylue) <a href=# rel=nofollow>July 7, 2019</a></p><p>Grammer fully defended her actions in a series of tweets, telling fans that Kemsley was responsible for #Puppygate and she didn’t understand why she was playing the victim and “the coven” was backing Kemsley up.</p><p>The 50-year-old thinks that Kemsley gave Lucy Lucy Apple Juice to a friend, and then the ladies helped her cover it up when the dog ended up in a kill shelter instead of back at Vanderpump Dogs. Then, when the story made its way to the press, it became all about who leaked it instead of the fact that Kemsley had broken an agreement.</p><p>Grammer wishes that Vanderpump would have shown up for the reunion taping to express her feelings because it was her chance to tell the cast what she was going through when they were filming Season 9. However, she says she does have empathy for LVP, who at the time was dealing with the sudden death of her brother, Mark.</p><p>During her Twitter rant, Grammer also accused the ladies of faking their friendships.</p><p>“What’s missing in this group #rhobh is the essence of true friendship. You don’t kick someone when their down. You don’t hold them accountable because there are struggle [sic] with their personal turmoil,” tweeted Grammer.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Camille Grammer went off on her <a href=# rel=nofollow>#RHOBH</a> co-stars in a Twitter rant ahead of their explosive reunion! <a href=# rel=nofollow>https://t.co/5EQKYclHwU</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow>pic.twitter.com/bG0WQOH6qf</a></p><p>— HollywoodLife (@HollywoodLife) <a href=# rel=nofollow>July 8, 2019</a></p><p>According to Reality Blurb, Grammer has become “the odd man out” this season after Vanderpump stopped filming with the rest of the cast halfway through the season. Because she wouldn’t join the anti-LVP gang, Camille Grammer says that the ladies were holding her accountable “for petty slights” during a difficult time in her life – just after her house burned down in the California Wildfires.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>The season finale of Real Housewives of Beverly Hills airs Tuesday night on Bravo. And, the reunion special – sans Lisa Vanderpump – will air on July 16th.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeTlrqquMueZKCqkaK6pr6MnKOaoZ2oerO0zpufZqWVlrtus8iro6xlmJaxbq2Mr5ynnJWpwaJ5wKCYoqajqXqttdKaZK%2BZnpmys7zUpqdma2BlgnV%2Bjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
