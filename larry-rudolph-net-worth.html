He is also widely recognized for legally representing several other big names of the entertainment industry, such as <a href=#>Justin Timberlake</a>, <a href=#>Miley Cyrus</a>, <a href=#>The Backstreet Boys</a> and <a href=#>DMX</a> among plenty of others.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how much wealth this artist’ manager has accumulated so far? How rich Larry Rudolph is? According to sources, it is estimated that the total of Larry Rudolph’s net worth, as of mid-2017, exceeds the sum of $23 million, acquired through his 15-years long attorney career as well as personal managment career which has been regularly active since 2003.</p><h3>Larry Rudolph Net Worth $23 million</h3><p>Larry began his professional attorney career in the early 1990s. In 1992 he opened his own firm, Rudolph & Beer, and turned towards entertainment law. During his law career, which officially ended in 2003 when he closed his firm, Larry collaborated and represented numerous big names of the music industry including, apart from those already mentioned, will.i.am, <a href=#>Toni Braxton</a>, <a href=#>Avril Lavigne</a> and <a href=#>Nicole Scherzinger</a>. This whole legal venture provided the basis for Larry Rudolph’s nowadays rather impressive net worth.</p><p>In 1997 Rudolph discovered talented 16-year old dancer and singer <a href=#>Britney Spears</a>. Under his guidance, Spears recorded and released her debut solo album in 1999, entitled “…Baby One More Time”, which proved to be a huge commercial success, providing hit singles such as the eponymous title song “…Baby One More Time” as well as “Sometimes” and “(You Drive Me) Crazy”. This accomplishment made <a href=#>Britney Spears</a> a pop superstar, while adding a significant sum to Larry Rudolph’s net worth.</p><p>Ever since, Rudolph has been serving as <a href=#>Britney Spears</a>‘ personal manager and agent, except a four year-long break in collaboration during her “crazy” period between 2004 and 2008, abundant with substance abuse during which he was fired. Nowadays, apart from their business collaboration, Larry and <a href=#>Britney</a> are big friends.</p><p>In 2007, alongside Nicole Winnaman, Larry Rudolph founded his own management firm – Total Entertainment and Arts Marketing, while in 2009 he launched his own production company named Reign Deer Entertainment. Besides all these, Rudolph is one of the main people responsible for setting Lindsay Lohan’s career back on the rising path, as well as for launching new girl group named G.R.L. and Adelitas Way’s music career. Doubtlessly, all these achievements have helped Larry Rudolph to massively increase the total of his revenues.</p><p>Besides all these, Larry has also produced over a dozen motion pictures through his Reign Deer Entertainment, such as the 2002 movie featuring <a href=#>Britney Spears</a> in the main role – “Crossroads” – as well as two TV series, “There & Back: Ashley Parker Angel” and “Newlyweds: Nick and Jessica”. These involvements made a notable impact on Larry Rudolph’s wealth.</p><p>When it comes to his personal life, Larry Rudolph has managed to keep it private as there aren’t any relevant data about his private matters, except that in 2016 he married Jen Barnett with whom he later welcomed a son. With his family, Rudolph divides his time between New York City and Los Angeles.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<h3 class=toggle-head>Producer <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=producer readability=22><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr readability=4><td>Miley Cyrus: Bangerz Tour</td><td>2014</td><td>TV Special documentary executive producer</td><td></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>I Am Britney Jean</td><td>2013</td><td>TV Movie documentary executive producer</td><td></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Miley: The Movement</td><td>2013</td><td>TV Movie documentary executive producer</td><td></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>The Pauly D Project</td><td>2012</td><td>TV Series executive producer</td><td></td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Britney Spears Live: The Femme Fatale Tour</td><td>2011</td><td>TV Movie executive producer</td><td></td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Britney Spears: I Am the Femme Fatale</td><td>2011</td><td>TV Movie documentary executive producer</td><td></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Britney: For the Record</td><td>2008</td><td>TV Movie documentary executive producer</td><td></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Rock the Cradle</td><td>2008</td><td>TV Series executive producer</td><td></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Sunset Tan</td><td>2008</td><td>TV Series co-executive producer - 1 episode</td><td></td></tr><tr readability=4><td>There & Back: Ashley Parker Angel</td><td>2006</td><td>TV Series co-executive producer - 1 episode</td><td></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Britney Spears: Greatest Hits - My Prerogative</td><td>2004</td><td>Video executive producer</td><td></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Brave New Girl</td><td>2004</td><td>TV Movie executive producer</td><td></td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Britney Spears Live from Miami</td><td>2004</td><td>TV Movie documentary executive producer</td><td></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Newlyweds: Nick & Jessica</td><td>2003</td><td>TV Series producer</td><td></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>In the Zone</td><td>2003</td><td>TV Movie executive producer</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Crossroads</td><td>2002/I</td><td>executive producer</td><td></td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Britney Spears Live from Las Vegas</td><td>2001</td><td>TV Special documentary executive producer</td><td></td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Miscellaneous <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=miscellaneous readability=4.5><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr readability=4><td>Britney Spears Live: The Femme Fatale Tour</td><td>2011</td><td>TV Movie manager: britney spears tour - show conceived & produced by</td><td></td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Britney Spears Live from Las Vegas</td><td>2001</td><td>TV Special documentary legal: Dream Within a Dream tour personnel / manager: Dream Within a Dream tour personnel / manager: Wright Entertainment Group</td><td></td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Thanks <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=thanks readability=1><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>Britney Spears: Criminal</td><td>2011</td><td>Video short special thanks</td><td></td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Self <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=self readability=6><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr><td>I Am Britney Jean</td><td>2013</td><td>TV Movie documentary</td><td>Himself - Manager</td></tr><tr><td>E!
