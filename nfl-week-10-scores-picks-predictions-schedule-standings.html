Rookie running back Bijan Robinson has three touches for 10 yards and one touchdown and tight end Kyle Pitts has two touches for 12 yards and one touchdown in those 41 plays.</p><p>“You’re going to call what you think gives you the best opportunity to go score a touchdown,” coach Arthur Smith said when asked to explain his thinking behind play-calling near the goal line. “There’s a fine line to it about who’s the primary in the passing game and what you’re trying to set up.”</p><p>Tight end Jonnu Smith leads Atlanta in low red zone touches with four.</p><p>The defense does “have a say, too, but there are things you’re trying to attack,” Arthur Smith said. “At the end of the day, we’ve got to find a way. Where we’re trending offensively … there’s a lot of really good things, but what ultimately matters is you have to score more points.”</p><p>Robinson is averaging 2.9 yards per carry and 39.8 rushing yards per game in his last five games (69 rushes for 199 yards). He has 63 total receiving yards in that span. Robinson is healthy, Smith said.</p><p>“He played a lot of snaps (against Minnesota), and sometimes, his impact away from the ball can open things up,” Smith said. “For any rookie, the seasons are long. You’re going to have ebbs and flows. We’ll see how this second half of the season goes, but he’s been a huge part of our offense and he’ll continue to be.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqutbTLnquim16YvK57y6KtnmWSobyov46nnaVlp5qyrHmQaWSsm5%2BnsrR5z6KapKtdpb%2BmsMicq6Knnqh6tK%2FHnpuupJViwLWtzZ2gp5%2BjZJpxk5CSeI6Dg4iyo3unf4yEjXyBmpifoqdm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
