Paltrow is an Academy Award-winning actress known for dozens of roles, including “Emma”, “Shakespeare in Love”, “Iron Man”, and “Glee”. Coldplay singer/songwriter Chris Martin is a two-time Grammy winner (2009 Song of the Year; 2004 Record of the Year). The couple met shortly after Paltrow’s dad died in 2002 while Martin was on tour with Coldplay and married about a year later in California. The couple has two children together: Apple Blythe Alison, who was born in 2004, and Moses Bruce Anthony, born in 2006. Paltrow has said that she chose her son’s name after Martin wrote a song called “Moses” for her before they tied the knot. Martin also penned and recorded a Coldplay song “The Nappies” about the upcoming birth of his first daughter. He has also said his band’s well-known tune “Speed of Sound” was drawn from his experience as a dad. In early 2014, Paltrow revealed in a letter on her website that she and Martin were separating after a decade together.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8KorKmklah8pLTRoqpmpZGnwaq6jKCuoqaVqXqvsdNmrqiqpJ18</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
