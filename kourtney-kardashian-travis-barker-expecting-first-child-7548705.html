Holding up a handwritten sign with large black letters that read, "Travis I'm Pregnant," Kourtney captured the attention of cameras and Barker's bandmate Mark Hoppus who told the crowd: "Someone's having a baby." In a clip shared to Kardashian's Instagram grid, Barker appeared shocked by the news while standing on stage, before eventually making his way down into the audience to kiss his wife.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Not only was Kardashian's pregnancy reveal super cute, but it also was a reference to Blink-182's "All the Small Things" music video, in which a fan waves a nearly-identical sign.&nbsp;<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kourtney is already a mom to three children — Mason, 13, Penelope, 10, and 8-year-old Reign — whom she shares with her ex Scott Disick, while Travis also has three kids with his ex Shanna Moakler, including son, Landon, 19, daughter Alabama, 17, and stepdaughter Atiana, 24.&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While Kourtney and Travis have been friends for years, they didn't go public with their romance until February 2021. They got engaged several months later, and had three weddings the following year, with the main event taking place during a multi-day lavish affair in Portofino, Italy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Even before their wedding, the couple has been open about their desire to have a child together. They attempted to have a baby <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>through IVF</a> without any success, and during the season three premiere of the show last month, Kourtney shared they recently stopped the process. "We are officially done with IVF," Kourtney said in a confessional. "We would love a baby more than anything, but I really believe in what God has in store for us. If that's a baby, I believe it will happen."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57yqisq6yemsZut8Crm5qrmJ6ur3nTq5ivoaNir6K%2Byp6pZp2opbKkwMinnmaemafAtXnCoaClnF1sgnWElmls</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VivaX - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
