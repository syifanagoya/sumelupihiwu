It is available on streaming services such as AcornTV, Amazon Channel, and Hoopla.</p><p>Hulu has only included 13 seasons of the Canadian drama on its lineup, which already has an expiration badge. And it’s always good to prioritize the titles you know will leave the service soon.</p><p>Considering the same, the platform lets its user know when episodes will be leaving in the next two weeks. Expiring tags indicate how many days are left to watch before the expiration date.</p><p>However, in some cases, content on Hulu expires but keeps existing there, and we can be hopeful the same applies to Murdoch Mysteries.</p><figure class="article-content-image fs-12 text-muted text-center my-3"></figure><p>The matter has had fans concerned with many expressing their views and thoughts on various social media platforms. A&nbsp;Twitter user&nbsp;wrote, “@HULU ARE YOU SERIOUSLY CANCELLING MURDOCH MYSTERIES??”</p><p>The user further said she will be canceling Hulu and getting a VPN -quite furious.</p><p>Another worried fan said, “They’re taking Murdoch Mysteries off @hulu???? Noooo I’m only on season 9. Why would they do that to me,” added with a loudly crying face emoji.</p><p>A separate individual shared he has been binging the series for months on Hulu but it has only 13 seasons available. Adding more to his sorrow, all seasons will be soon dropping off of the service.</p><p>Hulu’s support team confirmed the departure of the series on Twitter by replying to the fans tweets.</p><p>Viewers say the series is mostly predictable but they find it entertaining at the same time. “Murdoch Mysteries, on hulu .. its interesting and set in the early 1900s,” tweeted a fan.</p><figure class="article-content-image fs-12 text-muted text-center my-3"></figure><p>Even those people who have never known about it and randomly found it on Hulu are addicted to it. Many of them have made a routine of watching a few episodes of the drama every night before going to bed.</p><p>It has generally received positive reviews from viewers and has gained a high IMDb rating of 8.2 stars out of 10.</p><p>It is a fine series with a thoughtful and charming lead. The series presents the best of the detective who pioneers innovative and unique forensic techniques to solve some of the city’s most terrible crimes.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-leaving-hulu-in-april-2023></span>What Is Leaving Hulu in April 2023?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>May is drawing near, which suggests a reshuffle in the catalogs of all the streaming services and Hulu is no exception.</p><p>Hulu offers one of the best streaming lineups between its selections of original movies and shows, films and series from other studios, and the extended library of 20th Century Studios.</p><p>And while there is always something new on the platform every month, Hulu is not immune from the monthly churn of streaming.</p><p>Exciting films and TV shows come and go every month. But that doesn’t mean viewers have to let it depart without catching their favorite before they finally bid goodbye.</p><figure class="article-content-image fs-12 text-muted text-center my-3"></figure><p>For this, streaming platforms, such as Hulu, Disney+, Peacock, and&nbsp;Paramount Plus, add an expiration tag on the content and many other trusted sites even provide a full list of titles leaving the service.</p><p>From the action drama, The Last Duel to the sports documentary Venus and Serena all are departing from Hulu. And while some of the leaving titles may probably return, others may be gone for a while.</p><p>Other notable titles leaving the service include Neil Cross’ psychological crime thriller,&nbsp;Luther&nbsp;and Nell Scovell’s television sitcom&nbsp;Sabrina The Teenage Witch.</p><p>Here we’ve put together the list of everything departing Hulu in April 2023 (some of which have already left the service)</p><p><strong>April 13</strong></p><ul><li>The Last Duel (2021)</li></ul><p><strong>April 14</strong></p><ul><li>Centurion</li><li>Filth</li><li>Hobo With A Shotgun</li><li>I’m Still Here</li><li>Ragnarok</li><li>Venus And Serena</li><li>Viva</li></ul><p><strong>April 19</strong></p><ul><li>Annabelle: Creation</li></ul><figure class="article-content-image fs-12 text-muted text-center my-3"></figure><p><strong>April 30</strong></p><ul><li>2012</li><li>50/50</li><li>Are We There Yet?</li><li>Barney’s Version</li><li>Being Julia</li><li>Busco Novio Para Mi Mujer</li><li>The Cable Guy</li><li>Client 9</li><li>Darkness Falls</li><li>Date Movie</li><li>The Departed</li><li>The Expendables</li><li>The Expendables 2</li><li>The Expendables 3</li><li>Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer</li><li>First Daughter</li><li>Gnomeo & Juliet</li><li>The Green Mile</li><li>The Help</li><li>How Do You Know</li><li>I, Robot</li><li>If Beale Street Could Talk</li></ul><figure class="article-content-image fs-12 text-muted text-center my-3"></figure><ul><li>The Internship</li><li>It’s Complicated</li><li>Jiro Dreams of Sushi</li><li>Just My Luck</li><li>Kissing Jessica Stein</li><li>Lee Daniels’ The Butler</li><li>Life or Something Like It</li><li>Man on Fire</li><li>Never Been Kissed</li><li>Once</li><li>Paranoia</li><li>Perks of Being a Wall Flower</li><li>Ruby Sparks</li><li>Safe House</li><li>Saving Private Perez</li><li>Scarface</li><li>Something’s Gotta Give</li><li>Surrogates</li><li>Thank You for Smoking</li><li>The Town</li><li>The Triplets of Belleville</li><li>Water for Elephants</li><li>Welcome to the Rileys</li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=where-to-watch-murdoch-mysteries></span>Where To Watch Murdoch Mysteries?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Murdoch Mysteries is available to watch on Hulu, Prime Video, Acorn TV, Apple TV, or Hoopla on your Roku device.</p><p>You can also buy the series as a download on Amazon Video, Google Play Movies, and Apple TV.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=hulu></span>Hulu<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><figure class="article-content-image fs-12 text-muted text-center my-3"></figure><p>13 seasons of Murdoch Mysteries are available to watch on Hulu.
